🐤 Flappy Bird Game (Made with Pygame)

Hi! 👋
This is a Flappy Bird–style game that I created using Python and Pygame.
The game is easy to play and was built mainly for learning and fun 🎮

🌟 What is this game?

You control a small bird 🐦
Your goal is to keep the bird flying and pass through the gaps between pipes.
If the bird hits a pipe or the ground — Game Over!

🎮 How to Play

Press SPACEBAR to make the bird jump

Try to avoid the pipes

Each pipe you pass = 1 point

Survive as long as you can!

🛠️ What I Used

Python 3

Pygame library

That’s it! Simple and beginner-friendly 😊

▶️ How to Run the Game
Step 1: Install Python

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Step 2: Install Pygame

Open terminal / command prompt and type:

pip install pygame

Step 3: Run the Game
python flappybird.py


🎉 The game window will open — start playing!

🧠 How the Game Works (Simple Explanation)

The bird falls down because of gravity

Pressing SPACE makes the bird fly up

Pipes move from right to left

The game checks for collisions

Score increases when the bird passes pipes
